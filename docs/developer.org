* Casual Symbol Overlay Development
Casual Symbol Overlay is an open source project and as such is always open for contributors to its development.

This document provides guidance on how to contribute to its development from a programming perspective.

* Development Environment
Casual Symbol Overlay is developed primarily using a GNU toolchain. GNU tools required are:

- make
- awk
- grep
- bash

Also needed is the Python [[https://pypi.org/project/semver/][semver]] module. This will require an installation of Python 3.x, ideally at 3.9 or higher.

For source code management, Casual Symbol Overlay uses ~git~.

Given a clone of this repository, ensure that the directory holding ~casual-symbol-overlay.el~ is in your ~info-path~. Add the following lines to your Emacs initialization file.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-symbol-overlay) ;; optional
  (keymap-set symbol-overlay-map "C-o" #'casual-symbol-overlay-tmenu)
#+end_src


* Branches
For Casual Symbol Overlay development, there are two git branches of note:

- [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-symbol-overlay/tree/main][main]] for releases to the general public.
- [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-symbol-overlay/tree/development][development]] for staging of stable pre-release functionality.

Planned changes for the next release are done on feature branches that are merged via pull request into ~development~. Upon QA of ~development~, those changes are merged to ~main~ for release to the general public.

* Test Regression
Running the Casual Symbol Overlay test regression suite is done via Makefile. In the top-level directory of Casual Symbol Overlay, run this from the command line.

#+begin_src text
  $ make tests
#+end_src

Casual Symbol Overlay uses the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ert/][ERT]] framework to compose and manage tests.

One can run a test for a single file by using a "phony" target with a suffix of ~.elt~ in the ~lisp/~ directory containing all the source files.

For example, in the ~lisp/~ directory, run this command to exercise all tests for functions in ~casual-symbol-overlay-version.el~.

#+begin_src test
  $ make casual-symbol-overlay-version.elt
#+end_src


* External Pull Requests

Before you submit a pull request (PR):

- If it is a *new* feature, please propose an [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-symbol-overlay/issues][enhancement issue]] instead.
  - Your enhancement issue should be in the form of a products requirement document (PRD).
  - PRs without an approved PRD associated with it will be summarily rejected.
  - Contributing to code development for a PRD requires advance approval from the maintainer. PRs submitted outside of this flow will be rejected.
- PRs must pass the test regression suite.
  - New behavior introduced in a PR should have unit tests associated with it.
    - Typically this entails exercising all items in a Transient menu. Look at usage of ~casualt-suffix-testbench-runner~ in [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-lib/blob/main/tests/casual-lib-test-utils.el][casual-lib-test-utils.el]] to see how this is done.
- PRs must be made against the ~development~ branch on GitHub.
  - If the pull request is made against ~main~ but can be re-targeted to ~development~, it will be reviewed.
  - A pull request with merge conflicts to ~development~ will be summarily rejected.
      
All of the above is intended to ensure that Casual Symbol Overlay releases are of high quality.

* UX Guidelines

- Menus must not exceed 80 characters in length.
  - Rationale: Casual Symbol Overlay follows suit with current Elisp format to conform to the line width of an ADM-3A terminal.
