* Casual Symbol Overlay
An opinionated [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]]-based user interface for [[https://github.com/wolray/symbol-overlay][Symbol Overlay]].

[[file:docs/images/casual-symbol-overlay-screenshot.png]]

* Motivation

The *Symbol Overlay* (~symbol-overlay~) package has many useful functions and bindings that if not used frequently are easy to forget. Menus are a user interface (UI) affordance that offer users discoverability and recall that can lower its learning curve. While menus are commonly associated with mouse-driven UI, the inclusion of Transient in Emacs core allows for a menu UI that is keyboard-driven. Casual Symbol Overlay endeavors to offer this as many Emacs users prefer keyboard-driven workflows.

** Goals
- To provide a keyboard-driven menu UI for editing symbol-overlay.
- To provide casual access to the Symbol Overlay command set.

** Non-Goals
- Full coverage of all bookmark list commands. Casual Symbol Overlay is not intended to be a power user tool.
- Strict adherence to bookmark list command naming. While Casual Symbol Overlay is *mostly* in alignment with ~symbol-overlay~ list command naming, there are cases where it will make an opinionated change if the name is deemed too vague or idiomatic.
- UX Stability (for now). Given that Casual Symbol Overlay is early in its life-cycle, expect changes to its user experience in terms of menu hierarchy and keybinding choices in future releases.

* Requirements
Casual Symbol Overlay requires:
- Emacs 29.1+
- Symbol Overlay 4.2+
- Casual Lib 1.1.0+

Casual Symbol Overlay has been verified with the following configuration. 
- Emacs 29.4 (macOS 14.5, Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4 LTS)

* Asks
As Casual Symbol Overlay is new, we are looking for early adopters! Your [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-symbol-overlay/discussions][feedback]] is welcome as it will likely impact Casual Symbol Overlay's evolution, particularly with regards to UI.

* Install
If installed via MELPA then add these lines to your Emacs initialization file with your binding of preference. For consistency with other Casual packages for different modes, use ~C-o~. 
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-symbol-overlay) ;; optional
  (keymap-set symbol-overlay-map "C-o" #'casual-symbol-overlay-tmenu)
#+end_src

If you use ~use-package~, here is the recipe for installing and configuring it.
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (use-package casual-symbol-overlay
    :ensure t
    :bind (:map
           symbol-overlay-map
           ("C-o" . casual-symbol-overlay-tmenu)))
#+end_src

* Usage
Given a symbol already highlighted with ~symbol-overlay-mode~, move the point over any part of that symbol. Enter the binding ~C-o~ to raise the Transient menu ~casual-symbol-overlay-tmenu~. 

* Common Menu Actions
Casual Symbol Overlay is built using Transient menus and as such adopts much of its default behavior.

Each menu item has a /key/ and a /label/. The /key/ is what is typed by the user to select the menu item. A key can be prefixed with a meta (M-) or control (C-) key. 

Dismissing a menu regardless of how deep you are in sub-menus can be done by entering ~C-q~. A menu can also be dismissed by entering ~C-g~, but this will return you to the parent menu.

If a mouse is available, a menu item can be selected by moving the mouse cursor over its label and pressing down button 1.

Pressing the ~?~ key will toggle help for all the menu items. Press the key of interest to get help for it.

When a Transient menu is raised, a prefix argument (~C-u~) can be entered before selecting a menu item.
